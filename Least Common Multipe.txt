LCM is the short form for “Least Common Multiple.” The least common multiple is defined as the smallest multiple that two or more numbers have in common.
For example: Take two integers, 2 and 3. 

Multiples of 2: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20….

Multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30 ….

6, 12, and 18 are common multiples of 2 and 3. The number 6 is the smallest. Therefore, 6 is the least common multiple of 2 and 3.So, what is LCM in math? The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number divisible by both numbers.One prime application of LCM is finding the lowest common denominator (LCD) of two or more fractions. It plays a significant role in adding, subtracting, and comparing two or more fractions.

Write a function that takes two numbers as input and returns their lowest common multiple.Check if your function works correctly by calling it for some suitable inputs.
